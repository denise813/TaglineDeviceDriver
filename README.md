# TaglineDeviceDriver

This project is a device driver for a multi-disk RAID array.
It includes a data recovery method for corrupted and failed disks, a RAID cache with LRU ejection policy and write through semantics. 
It also allows the user to send RAID requests over a network through a loopback interface designed for this project.
